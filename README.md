# Brain-Tumor-Classification
 Brain tumor MRI classification is a medical image analysis process that uses machine learning to classify MRI scans as benign or malignant. By leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNNs), this method identifies key patterns and anomalies in brain images, aiding in accurate diagnosis and treatment planning. It's vital for early detection and improved patient outcomes.
